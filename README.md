 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1
// I planned on making a snowboarding video game but I was having trouble getting the physics and movement of the player to work properly.
//I changed my idea and decided to make the player a UFO that can go around and fire lasers at buildings.
//As of right now I am still having trouble getting the lasers to instantiate correctly.
